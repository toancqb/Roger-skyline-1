                <h1>This is the best roger-skyline-1 landing page. Period.</h1>
                Why?
        </header>
        <h2>
                Because it's not a full blow application. Why? Because that's not the point of this project.
        </h2>
        <p>
                Let's be honest, I didn't do this project so that I could spend 90% of my time
                trying to learn how to develop a web app. If I wanted to do that, I would be
                in the web branch. But I'm not. Deal with it.
        </p>
        <p> Reasons why this is the <i><strong>best</strong></i> Roger-Skyline-1 landing page:</p>
        <ul>
                <li> It's <i>fast.</i> </li>
                <li> It's clean <i>and</i> simple. </li>
                <li> It's not ugly </li>
                <li> Did I mention it's fast? </li>
                <li> Did I also mention it's simple? No fancy web app, which means absolutely <i>no</i> crashing. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pls give 100. I need level 7. Pls.</strong></p>
